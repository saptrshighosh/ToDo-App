## Ambient Audio Files Setup

Ambient Audio files are not included in this repository due to file size constraints. To enable the ambient sound player:

* Find the `sounds` folder in the project root directory
* Add the following MP3 files with exact filenames:
  * `birds.mp3`
  * `rain.mp3`
  * `rain+thunder.mp3`
  * `crickets.mp3`
  * `cafe.mp3`

For optimal experience, use longer audio tracks suitable for seamless looping.
