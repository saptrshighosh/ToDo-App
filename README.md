A simple yet powerful to-do list application designed to help you organize your day and stay focused.

## Core Features

### ‚úÖ Task Management
* **Plan Ahead**: Easily add tasks for both **"Today"** and **"Tomorrow"**.
* **Stay Organized**: Mark tasks as complete, edit them directly by clicking on the text, or delete them when you're done.
* **Prioritize with Ease**: **Drag and drop** your tasks to reorder them however you like.
* **Automatic Day Rollover**: Tasks you've set for "Tomorrow" will automatically move to the "Today" list when the day changes.
* **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks, name, and theme preference are all saved in your browser's local storage, so they'll be there when you come back.

### üé® Personalization & UI
* **Personal Greeting**: You can **edit the name** at the top for a personalized welcome.
* **Light & Dark Modes**: Switch between a beautiful Light and a sleek Dark theme to suit your preference.
* **Interactive Background**: Enjoy a relaxing, interactive **water-orb animation** that gently floats in the background.
* **Responsive Design**: The app features a clean, modern interface that looks great and works perfectly on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

### üçÖ Pomodoro Timer
* **Boost Productivity**: A fully functional, built-in **Pomodoro timer** helps you stay focused.
* **Classic Cycle**: It follows the traditional Pomodoro technique with focus sessions, short breaks, and a longer break after four completed focus sessions.
* **Customizable Durations**: You can easily change the length of the focus, short break, and long break periods in the settings.
* **Draggable & Pinnable**: The timer window can be **dragged anywhere** on the screen and "pinned" to lock it in place.

### üéß Ambient Sound Player
* **Create Your Atmosphere**: Set the perfect mood for work or relaxation with the built-in ambient sound player.
* **Layer Sounds**: The player's best feature‚Äîyou can **play multiple sounds at once** to create a custom soundscape (like combining Rain + Cafe).
* **Looping Audio**: Choose from several high-quality, looping sounds: **Birds, Rain, Storm, Crickets, and Cafe**.
* **Volume Control**: Adjust the master volume for all playing sounds with a simple slider.
* **Draggable & Pinnable**: Just like the timer, this window is also fully draggable and can be pinned.

### Note on Sound Files

Please note that the MP3 files for the ambient sound player are **not included** in this project due to their large size. To get the sound player working, you'll need to add your own audio files. Here‚Äôs how:

1.  In the main project folder, you will find the `sounds` fodler.
2.  Find or download your preferred MP3 files for the ambient sounds. They work best if they are longer tracks that can be looped.
3.  Rename your files **exactly** as listed below and place them inside the `sounds` folder you created:
    * `birds.mp3`
    * `rain.mp3`
    * `rain+thunder.mp3`
    * `crickets.mp3`
    * `cafe.mp3`
